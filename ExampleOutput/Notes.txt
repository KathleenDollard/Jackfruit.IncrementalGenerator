x Use Type extensions on properties 
x Create new command class 
* Incorporate Chet's Validator work
* Don't forget global option

* From Mikayla, design where we allow the invocation context to be affected by base commands, to allow things like project on dotnet. 
  * Example of what we need to support for `dotnet` CLI and VSMac CLI: `exampleoutput nextgeneration --foo voyager --greeting Hello -- janeway`
  * The method signature could include an expressive wrapper line `Processed<T>`. Match by name and type
  * The could also be an expressive wrapper like `TheRestOfIt` for unhandled tokens/remaining string
  * The base generated commands could have an opportunity to alter the InvocationContext, if we can add data to it to add more data fields
